# DSV-COVID-19

Deep South Voice is releasing the code and data files of county level counts of coronavirus cases across the Deep South. We have used datasets available from Johns Hopkins and the Covid Tracking Project to create a cleaned, time-series dataset providing a complete record of the ongoing outbreak specific to our region. 

We have used this code and the datasets it generates to power our maps and assist in our reporting and are now making it available to the public.
